				<h1>About the Designer</h1>
				<p>(Well, a link may be in the nav, but that would mean more than one page ;) )</p>
				<p>My name is Josh Sawyer, and I like to get my feet wet in all things technology. My career lined up for the Fall my be just "IT", but I like to explore any and everything in the world of tech.</p>
				<br>
				<p>My main experieces are in programming languages such as PHP, Javascript, and Python as well as the usual web languages (HTML, CSS, etc). I began web design using Dreamweaver, but I grew tired of the bloated obtrusive, interface. Currently I rock out with Sublime Text Editor, a window of chrome (sometimes from WAMP), a command window for quick commits, and a 2nd chrome window for refrences, videos, music, or other coding assistance. Needless to say I make full use of both my monitors.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				My one glaring weakness in the world of web design is certainly photoshop and other design software. The things people can make in those programs is nothing short of magic.
