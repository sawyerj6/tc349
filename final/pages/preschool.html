            <h2>Sunday School</h2>
            <p>
                Sunday School is offered for children age 3 through High School for one hour each Sunday from September through May. Preschool (3's and 4's), 7th/8th Grade, and High School meet in self-contained classes. Grades K-6 meet in Fellowship Hall for singing and prayers at Sunday School Opening, and then travel by age groups to a different workshop each week.
                <br>
                The Workshop Rotational Model takes into account children's need for repetition and their love of experiential learning. Our goal is in-depth learning about and familiarity with the most important stories of the Bible by the time our children reach Middle School. Each year, we emphasize a different theme, and study five or six stories related to that theme. This means that our children spend about five weeks learning about a single story, instead of just one! Instead of reporting to the same classroom and the same teacher each Sunday, children attend a different workshop each week to experience the story in many different ways. Over a five-week period, children rotate through five workshops such as arts & crafts, science & nature, cooking, video, games, storytelling, and more. We use our own curriculum for our Workshop Rotational Sunday School and our teachers are our parents! Congregational members, staff, grandparents, and youth are teachers too.
